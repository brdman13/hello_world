Its dangerous to go alone. Take this.

Hello Github, hopefully I am not in over my head but recently I have discovered the joys of web-development and coding.  Like any respectable newb I'm sure I will make a lot of people role their eyes at the naivety of my questions and the primitive nature of my code.  But slow and steady will hopefully win this race and get me out of my current career path and into a new one.
